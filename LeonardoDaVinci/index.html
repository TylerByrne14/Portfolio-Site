                Mona Lisa is an oil painting on a poplar wood panel by Leonardo
                da Vinci, probably the world’s most famous painting. It was
                painted sometime between 1503 and 1519, when Leonardo was living
                in Florence, and it now hangs in the Louvre Museum, Paris, where
                it remained an object of pilgrimage in the 21st century. The
                sitter’s mysterious smile and her unproven identity have made
                the painting a source of ongoing investigation and fascination.

                painted for the Dominican monastery Santa Maria delle Grazie in
                Milan. It depicts the dramatic scene described in several
                closely connected moments in the Gospels. According to
                Leonardo’s belief that posture, gesture, and expression should
                manifest the “notions of the mind,” each one of the 12 disciples

                This painting depicts Christ as the Savior of the World. He is
                shown in Renaissance dress, with two fingers extended as he
                gives a benediction. In his left hand, he holds a crystal orb,
                which represents the crystalline sphere of the heavens. Salvator
                Mundi became the most expensive work of art ever sold when it
                was auctioned at Christie’s, New York, on November 15, 2017, for
                $450.3 million. The unprecedented sum for a heavily restored
                painting with questionable attribution made the Salvator Mundi,
                arguably, the most controversial painting of the 21st century.

                This painting depicts Christ as the Savior of the World. He is
                shown in Renaissance dress, with two fingers extended as he
                gives a benediction. In his left hand, he holds a crystal orb,
                which represents the crystalline sphere of the heavens. Salvator
                Mundi became the most expensive work of art ever sold when it
                was auctioned at Christie’s, New York, on November 15, 2017, for
                $450.3 million. The unprecedented sum for a heavily restored
                painting with questionable attribution made the Salvator Mundi,
                arguably, the most controversial painting of the 21st century.
