# Portfolio-Site

This is my current personal website portfolio. This layout is responsive to all screen sizes. 
In this project I wanted to show that I enjoy simple but functional design and allow viewers to 
learn a bit about me. I have always been a fan of the phrase "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication", 
and I think that inspired the design of this project. I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, Figma, and Font Awesome 
to make this site. This was the most fun Iâ€™ve ever had making a project as I had total reign of the design and 
development. This gave me an oppourtunity to play around with a bunch of different animations and layouts while 
utilizing flexbox and grid.
